# Rubiks.c
I made this simple program using C and Code Composer Studio, running it on the MSP430. 
Program can turn a rubiks cube and print out the results. 
Program is mostly finished but is missing a user interface and is sometimes buggy when using the last 3 of 9 operations (which is when you turn the left, top, right, or bottom sides vertically). 
Feel free to drop any comments or suggest changes, thanks for looking at my program / second post.
